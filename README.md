Installing from PyPI:

Or building package from source:

Ta-Lib is additionally required for technical indicator support.

### Dependencies

Quantmod requires plotly, numpy, pandas and pandas_datareader to work properly (hard dependencies). In addition, an installation of Ta-Lib is strongly recommended as it is required for technical indicator support.

The hard dependencies should be automatically installed with pip, but Ta-Lib requires a longer install.
